Obtaining aperture photometry of your standards
-----------------------------------------------

Standard stars provide a good example of relatively uncrowded photometry, and in
this section we will describe hot to obtain instrumental for your standards.
The basic steps are

- `Picking an aperture size`_: decide what aperture size you whish to use for
  measuring your standards (**this should be the same for all the frames**). At
  the same time pick a sky annulus.
- `Setting things up`_: set up various parameters (**fwhm, threshold, sky
  annulus, aperture radius**) to have correct values.
- `Doing it: aperture photometry at last`_: for each frame

   1. Identify the standard star(s) either interactively using a cursor or by
      using an automatic star finding algorithm.

   2. Obtain aperture photometry for each of your standard stars.
