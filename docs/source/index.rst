A User's Guide to Stellar CCD Photometry with Python
=======================================================

This document is a guide to performing stellar photometry on CCD data
using `photutils`__, an `astropy`__ affiliated package.

It follows roughly the same steps outlined in Massey & Lindsey's `A User's Guide
to Stellar CCD Photometry with IRAF (1992)`__.

It is under development as of November 2016, with much work still needed.
